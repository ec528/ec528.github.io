### About Me

I am a postdoctoral researcher working with [Prof. Baris Kasikci](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~baris/) in the UW Systems Lab at the University of Washington. I earned my computer science Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in May 2023 where I worked with [Prof. Ryan Huang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/). 

My research is centered around the detection, diagnosis, and mitigation of systems performance issues. In my Ph.D. work, I developed principled approaches to improve the systems performance. Specifically, I contributed to the following areas:
- Intra-application performance interference: \[[pBox SOSP'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600006.3613159)\],\[[vprof Eurosys'23](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3552326.3587444)\]
- Specious configuration: \[[Violet OSDI'20](https://www.usenix.org/conference/osdi20/presentation/hu)\]
- Application misbehavior: \[[LeaseOS ASPLOS'19](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3297858.3304057)\](**Best paper award**)

I am currently focused on mitigating intra-application performance interference, employing a range of strategies from developing new scheduling mechanisms to utilizing large language models for assisting in performance issue diagnosis.

<!-- **Update: <span style="color:#8B0000;">I will be an Assistant Professor at ECE@Boston University, starting in Fall 2025.  Our lab has multiple Ph.D. student positions. If you are interested in building/hacking systems, we should talk.</span>** -->

## Bio

I received my Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University in June 2023, advised by Prof. Ryan (Peng) Huang I obtained my B.E. degree in Computer Science from Huazhong University of Science & Technology in 2017. When I was in HUST, I was fortunately worked with Prof. Hai Jin and Prof. Deqing Zou in the Cluster and Grid Computing Lab and [Prof. Shan Lu](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~shanlu/) at University of Chicago.

- My favorite proverb is "The scholar may not be without breadth of mind and vigorous endurance." from The Analects of Confucius. 
- If I don't do research, I would spend my time in reading history book, caring for my goldfish, playing Go and most importantly, spend time with my wife and kid.
