# Submission Instruction

We will collect your solution automatically through GitHub by taking a snapshot by the deadline. Thus, be sure to commit your changes and do a git push to GitHub, especially in the last few minutes! Your submission must reside in a branch called <span style="color:Crimson;">**lab2-handin**</span>. If you are developing in other branches, in the end, don't forget to merge changes from that branch to the <span style="color:Crimson;">**lab2-handin**</span> branch.
Double check that your submission resides in the correct branch <span style="color:Crimson;">**lab2-handin**</span> (note the middle part is a dash -, not underscore) by the deadline. Using a different branch name will result in failure to collect and grade your submission in time.

If you decide to use the late hour tokens, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdjrS-cIlkyTryoKthM-_w3j6kB0W9ZybTK9iL-7AbL56FfAg/viewform?usp=header) before the deadline, so that we won't be collecting and grading your solution immediately. When you finish (within the token limit), fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUj2ZREcwOGb5Wybd9k0cb0Cn3iGAK_c3lQfDv8XPEX1Jb6g/viewform?usp=header) again to indicate you are done. Don't forget to fill out the form for the second time to avoid leaking your late tokens.

# Project 2 Requirement 

## Suggested Order of Implementation

We suggest first implementing the following, which can happen in parallel:

* **Argument passing.** Every user program will page fault immediately until argument passing is implemented.
* **`halt` system call.** This is the easiest system call to implement, but it is a big step to have a working system call infrastructure. You should implement enough code to read the system call number from the user stack and dispatch it to a handler based on it.
* **The `exit` system call.** Every user program that finishes in the normal way calls `exit`. Even a program that returns from `main()` calls `exit` indirectly (see `_start()` in `lib/user/entry.c`).
* **The `write` system call** for writing to fd 1, the system console. All of our test programs write to the console (the user process version of `printf()` is implemented this way), so they will all malfunction until `write` is available.
* **For now, change `process_wait()` to an infinite loop (one that waits forever).** The provided implementation returns immediately, so Pintos will power off before any processes actually get to run. **You will eventually need to provide a correct implementation.**
* After the above are implemented, user processes should work minimally. At the very least, they can write to the console and exit correctly. **You can then refine your implementation so that some of the tests start to pass**.


## Task 0: Design Document

* Download the [project 2 design document template](./userprog.tmpl). Read through it to motivate your design and fill it in after you finish the project.
* We recommend that you read the design document template before you start working on the project.
* See section [Project Documentation](../reference/documentation.md), for a sample design document that goes along with a fictitious project.

## Task 1: Process Termination Messages

### **Exercise 1.1**

**Whenever a user process terminates**, because it called `exit` or for any other reason, print the process's name and exit code, formatted as if printed by `printf ("%s: exit(%d)\n", ...);`.

* The name printed should be **the full name** passed to `process_execute()`, omitting command-line arguments.
* **Do not print these messages when a kernel thread that is not a user process terminates, or when the `halt`system call is invoked.** The message is optional when a process fails to load.
* Aside from this, **don't print any other messages that Pintos as provided doesn't already print**. You may find extra messages useful during debugging, but they will confuse the grading scripts and thus lower your score.

</div>

## Task 2: Argument Passing

### Exercise 2.1

**Currently, `process_execute()` does not support passing arguments to new processes. You need to implement it in this task.**

* Implement this functionality, by extending `process_execute()` so that instead of simply taking a program file name as its argument, it divides it into words at spaces.
* The first word is the program name, the second word is the first argument, and so on. That is, `process_execute("grep foo bar")` should run `grep` passing two arguments `foo` and `bar`.
* Within a command line, **multiple spaces are equivalent to a single space**, so that `process_execute("grep foo bar")` is equivalent to our original example.
* **You can impose a reasonable limit on the length of the command line arguments.** For example, you could limit the arguments to those that will fit in a single page (4 kB). (There is an unrelated limit of 128 bytes on command-line arguments that the `pintos` utility can pass to the kernel.)

</div>

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Hint**

**You can parse argument strings any way you like.**

* If you're lost, look a&#x74;**`strtok_r()`**, prototyped in `lib/string.h` and implemented with thorough comments in `lib/string.c`. You can find more about it by looking at the man page (run `man strtok_r` at the prompt).
</div>

See section [Program Startup Details](lab2_background.md#6-program-startup-details), for information on exactly how you need to set up the stack.

## Task 3: Accessing User Memory

### Exercise 3.1

As part of a system call, the kernel must often access memory through pointers provided by a user program.

* <span style="color:red;">**The kernel must be very careful about doing so**</span>, because the user can pass a null pointer, a pointer to unmapped virtual memory, or a pointer to kernel virtual address space (above `PHYS_BASE`).
* All of these types of invalid pointers must be rejected without harm to the kernel or other running processes, by terminating the offending process and freeing its resources.

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">

<span style="color:green;">**Exercise 3.1**</span>

<span style="color:green;">Support</span> <span style="color:green;">**reading from**</span> <span style="color:green;">and</span> <span style="color:green;">**writing to**</span> <span style="color:green;">**user memory for system calls**</span><span style="color:green;">.</span>
</div>

**There are at least two reasonable ways to do this correctly.**

1. **The first method is to verify the validity of a user-provided pointer, then dereference it.**
   * If you choose this route, you'll want to look at the functions in `userprog/pagedir.c` and in `threads/vaddr.h`.
   * This is the **simplest** way to handle user memory access.
2. **The second method is to check only that a user pointer points below `PHYS_BASE`, then dereference it.**
   * An invalid user pointer will cause a _"page fault"_ that you can handle by modifying the code for `page_fault()` in `userprog/exception.c`.
   * This technique is normally **faster** because it takes advantage of the processor's MMU, so it tends to be used in real kernels (including Linux).

**In either case, you need to make sure not to "leak" resources.**

* For example, suppose that your system call has acquired a lock or allocated memory with `malloc()`.
* If you encounter an invalid user pointer afterward, you must still be sure to release the lock or free the page of memory.
* If you choose to verify user pointers before dereferencing them, this should be straightforward.
* It's more difficult to handle if an invalid pointer causes a page fault, because there's no way to return an error code from a memory access.

**Therefore, for those who want to try the latter technique, we'll provide a little bit of helpful code, which utilizes _assembly instructions_ and _page fault handler_ to return an error code from dereferencing an invalid pointer.** You may need to read some material related to assembly code yourself before you can fully understand it.

* <span style="color:blue;">**Helpful read/write Interfaces:**</span> Each of these functions assumes that the user address has already been verified to be below `PHYS_BASE`.

```cpp
/* Reads a byte at user virtual address UADDR.
   UADDR must be below PHYS_BASE.
   Returns the byte value if successful, -1 if a segfault
   occurred. */
static int
get_user (const uint8_t *uaddr)
{
  int result;
  asm ("movl $1f, %0; movzbl %1, %0; 1:"
       : "=&a" (result) : "m" (*uaddr));
  return result;
}

/* Writes BYTE to user address UDST.
   UDST must be below PHYS_BASE.
   Returns true if successful, false if a segfault occurred. */
static bool
put_user (uint8_t *udst, uint8_t byte)
{
  int error_code;
  asm ("movl $1f, %0; movb %b2, %1; 1:"
       : "=&a" (error_code), "=m" (*udst) : "q" (byte));
  return error_code != -1;
}
```

* <span style="color:blue;">**You need to modify**</span> **`page_fault()`** <span style="color:blue;">**meanwhile:**</span> If the page fault is triggered by a bad reference from a system call, merely sets `eax` to `0xffffffff` (as the return value `-1`) and copies its former value into `eip`.

```c
/* Page fault handler needs to be modified. 
   The following code is absolutely INCOMPLETE!!! */
static void
page_fault (struct intr_frame *f) 
{
   ...
   if (page_fault_triggered_by_a_bad_reference_from_a_system_call) 
   {
      f->eip = (void (*) (void)) f->eax;
      f->eax = -1;
      return;
   }
   ...
}
```

## Task 4: System Calls

### Exercise 4.1

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
<span style="color:green;">**Exercise 4.1**</span>

<span style="color:green;">**Implement the system call handler in**</span> **`userprog/syscall.c`.**

</div>

### Exercise 4.2

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
<span style="color:green;">**Exercise 4.2**</span>

<span style="color:green;">**Implement the following system calls. (13 in all for this lab)**</span>

* <span style="color:green;">The prototypes listed are those</span> <span style="color:green;">**seen by a user program**</span> <span style="color:green;">that includes</span> <span style="color:green;">`lib/user/syscall.h`</span><span style="color:green;">. (This header, and all others in</span> <span style="color:green;">`lib/user`</span><span style="color:green;">, are for use by user programs only.)</span>
* <span style="color:green;">**System call numbers**</span> <span style="color:green;">for each system call are defined in</span> <span style="color:green;">**`lib/syscall-nr.h`**</span><span style="color:green;">:</span>
</div>

* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: void halt (void)**</span>
  * **Terminates Pintos by calling `shutdown_power_off()`** (declared in `devices/shutdown.h`).
  * This should be seldom used, because you lose some information about possible deadlock situations, etc.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: void exit (int status)**</span>
  * Terminates the current user program, returning *status* to the kernel.
  * **If the process's parent `wait`s for it (see below), this is the _status_ that will be returned.** Conventionally, a _status_ of 0 indicates success and nonzero values indicate errors.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: pid\_t exec (const char \*cmd\_line)**</span>
  * Runs the executable whose name is given in *cmd\_line*, passing any given arguments, and returns the new process's program id (pid).
  * If the program cannot load or run for any reason, must return pid `-1`, which otherwise should not be a valid pid.
  * Thus, **the parent process cannot return from the `exec` until it knows whether the child process successfully loaded its executable**. You must use appropriate **synchronization** to ensure this.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: int wait (pid\_t pid)**</span>
  * **Waits for a child process&#x20;**_**pid**_ **and retrieves the child's exit status.**
  * **If  _pid_  is still alive:**
    * **Wait until it terminates.** Then, returns the **status** that _pid_ passed to `exit`.
    * If **pid did not call `exit()`**, but was terminated by the kernel (e.g. killed due to an exception), `wait(pid)` must return **-1**.
  * It is perfectly legal for a parent process to wait for child processes that have already terminated by the time the parent calls、`wait`,
    * but the kernel must still allow the parent to retrieve its child's exit status,
    * or learn that the child was terminated by the kernel.
  * `wait` must fail and return -1 immediately if any of the following conditions is true:
    1.  _**pid**_ does not refer to a _direct_ child of the calling process. _pid_ is a direct child of the calling process if and only if the calling process received pid as a return value from a successful call to `exec`.

        Note that **children are not inherited**: if A spawns child B and B spawns child process C, then A cannot wait for C, even if B is dead. A call to `wait(C)` by process A must fail.

        Similarly, **orphaned processes are not assigned to a new parent** if their parent process exits before they do.
    2. **The process that calls `wait` has already called `wait` on&#x20;**_**pid**_**.** That is, a process may wait for any given child at most once.
  * Processes may spawn any number of children, wait for them in any order, and may even exit without having waited for some or all of their children.
    * Your design should consider all the ways in which waits can occur.
    * All of a process's resources, including its `struct thread`, must be freed whether its parent ever waits for it or not, and regardless of whether the child exits before or after its parent.
  * **You must ensure that Pintos does not terminate until the initial process exits.**
    * The supplied Pintos code tries to do this by calling `process_wait()` (in `userprog/process.c`) from `pintos_init()` (in `threads/init.c`).
    * We suggest that you **implement `process_wait()` according to the comment at the top of the function** and then **implement the `wait` system call in terms of `process_wait()`**.

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Hint 1**

**You need to store several pieces of execution information such as&#x20;**_**exit status**_ **for each process in case its parent** **may call `wait`.**

* This information should be accessible to the parent process even after this process dies.
* You should consider storing it in the heap (e.g. using malloc()).
</div>

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Hint 2**

**Choosing where to initialize the execution information is important because the new process thread may finish before `process_execute` returns.**

* If some parts of the execution information are designated for the child process, you may need to initialize them at a point where you are certain the newly created thread has not finished executing yet.
* You may also want to read the **`thread_create`** function definition again, especially the last argument, which can help you pass argument from the parent thread to the child thread.
</div>

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Hint 3**

**Choosing when and where to free the execution information is also important.**

* The parent process could die before the child process and vice versa. You would want **whichever process that dies last to free the information**.
</div>

* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: bool create (const char \*file, unsigned initial\_size)**</span>
  * **Creates a new file called&#x20;**_**file**_**&#x20;initially&#x20;**_**initial\_size**_**&#x20;bytes in size.** Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
  * **Creating a new file does not open it**: opening the new file is a separate operation which would require a `open` system call.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: bool remove (const char \*file)**</span>
  * **Deletes the file called&#x20;**_**file**_**.** Returns true if successful, false otherwise.
  * A file may be removed regardless of whether it is open or closed, and removing an open file does not close it. See [Removing an Open File](lab2_faq.md#what-happens-when-an-open-file-is-removed), for details.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: int open (const char \*file)**</span>
  * **Opens the file called&#x20;**_**file**_**.** Returns a **nonnegative integer handle** called a "file descriptor" (fd), or **-1** if the file could not be opened.
  * **File descriptors numbered 0 and 1 are reserved for the console**: fd 0 (`STDIN_FILENO`) is standard input, fd 1 (`STDOUT_FILENO`) is standard output. **The `open` system call will never return either of these file descriptors**, which are valid as system call arguments only as explicitly described below.
  * **Each process has an independent set of file descriptors.** <span style="color:red;">**File descriptors are**</span> _<span style="color:red;">**not**</span>_ <span style="color:red;">**inherited by child processes (different from Unix semantics)!!!**</span>
  * **When a single file is opened more than once, whether by a single process or different processes, each `open` returns a new file descriptor.** Different file descriptors for a single file are closed independently in separate calls to `close` and they do not share a file position.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: int filesize (int fd)**</span>
  * Returns the size, in bytes, of the file open as *fd*.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: int read (int fd, void \*buffer, unsigned size)**</span>
  * Reads *size* bytes from the file open as *fd* into *buffer* . Returns **the number of bytes actually read (0 at end of file)**, or **-1** if the file could not be read (due to a condition other than end of file).
  * **Fd 0 reads from the keyboard using `input_getc()`.**
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: int write (int fd, const void \*buffer, unsigned size)**</span>
  * Writes *size* bytes from *buffer* to the open file *fd*. Returns **the number of bytes actually written**, which may be less than _size_ if some bytes could not be written.
  * Writing past end-of-file would normally extend the file, but file growth is not implemented by the basic file system. The expected behavior is to **write as many bytes as possible** up to end-of-file and return the actual number written, or 0 if no bytes could be written at all.
  * **Fd 1 writes to the console.**  Your code to write to the console should write all of *buffer* in one call *to* **`putbuf()`**, at least as long as _size_ is not bigger than a few hundred bytes. (It is reasonable to break up larger buffers.) Otherwise, lines of text output by different processes may end up interleaved on the console, confusing both human readers and our grading scripts.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: void seek (int fd, unsigned position)**</span>
  * Changes the next byte to be read or written in open file *fd* to  *position*, expressed in bytes from the beginning of the file.** (Thus, a position of 0 is the file's start.)
  * **A seek past the current end of a file is not an error.**
    * A later read obtains 0 bytes, indicating end of file.
    * A later write extends the file, filling any unwritten gap with zeros. (However, in Pintos files have a fixed length until project 4 is complete, so writes past end of file will return an error.)
    * These semantics are implemented in the file system and <span style="color:red;">**do not require any special effort**</span> in system call implementation.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: unsigned tell (int fd)**</span>
  * Returns the position of the next byte to be read or written in open file *fd*, expressed in bytes from the beginning of the file.
* <span style="color:CornFlowerBlue;">**System Call: void close (int fd)**</span>
  * Closes file descriptor *fd*.
  * Exiting or terminating a process implicitly closes all its open file descriptors, as if by calling this function for each one.

**The file defines other syscalls. Ignore them for now.** You will implement some of them in project 3 and the rest in project 4, so **be sure to design your system with extensibility in mind**.

#### Some Important Notes

To implement syscalls, you need to provide ways to read and write data in *user virtual address space*.

* You need this ability before you can even obtain the system call number, because the system call number is on the user's stack in the user's virtual address space.
* This can be a bit tricky: what if the user provides an invalid pointer, a pointer into kernel memory, or a block partially in one of those regions? **You should handle these cases by terminating the user process.** We recommend writing and testing this code before implementing any other system call functionality. See section [Accessing User Memory](lab2_requirement.md#task-3-accessing-user-memory), for more information.

**You must synchronize system calls so that any number of user processes can make them at once.**

* In particular, it is not safe to call into the file system code provided in the `filesys/` directory from multiple threads at once. <span style="color:red;">**Your system call implementation must treat the file system code as a critical section.**</span> **Don't forget that `process_execute()` also accesses files.** For now, we recommend **against** modifying code in the `filesys/` directory.

We have provided you a **user-level function** for each system call in **`lib/user/syscall.c`**. These provide a way for user processes to invoke each system call from a C program. Each uses a little **inline assembly code** to invoke the system call and (if appropriate) returns the system call's return value.

**When you're done with this part, and forevermore, Pintos should be bulletproof.** Nothing that a user program can do should ever cause the OS to crash, panic, fail an assertion, or otherwise malfunction.

* <span style="color:red;">**It is important to emphasize this point: our tests will try to break your system calls in many, many ways. You need to think of all the corner cases and handle them.**</span>
* The **sole** way a user program should be able to cause the OS to halt is by invoking the `halt` system call.
* If a system call is passed **an invalid argument**, acceptable options include **returning an error value (for those calls that return a value)**, **returning an undefined value**, or **terminating the process**.

See section [System Call Details](lab2_background.md#system-call-details), for details on how system calls work.

## Task 5: Denying Writes to Executables

### **Exercise 5.1**

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
<span style="color:green;">**Exercise 5.1**</span>

<span style="color:green;">**Add code to deny writes to files in use as executables.**</span>

* <span style="color:green;">Many OSes do this because of the unpredictable results if a process tried to run code that was in the midst of being changed on disk.</span>
* <span style="color:green;">This is especially important once virtual memory is implemented in project 3, but it can't hurt even now.</span>
</div>

**You can use `file_deny_write()` to prevent writes to an open file.**

* Calling **`file_allow_write()`** on the file will **re-enable** them (unless the file is denied writes by another opener).
* **Closing a file will also re-enable writes.** Thus, to deny writes to a process's executable, you must keep it open as long as the process is still running.
