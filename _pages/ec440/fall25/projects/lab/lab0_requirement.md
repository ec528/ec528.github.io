# Project 0 Requirements

## 0. Project 0 Design Document

Before you turn in your project, you must copy the [project 0 design document template](./real_tmpl0.txt) into your source tree under the name pintos/src/p0/DESIGNDOC and fill it in.

## 1. Booting Pintos

Have Pintos development environment setup as described in [Project Setup](../setup.md). Afterwards, execute


```
cd pintos/src/threads
make qemu
```

If everything works, you should see Pintos booting in the QEMU emulator, and print Boot complete. near the end. In addition to the shell where you execute the command, a new graphic window of QEMU will also pop up printing the same messages. 

Note that to quit the Pintos interface, for the QEMU window, you can just close it; for the terminal, you need to press `Ctrl-a x` to exit (if you are running inside GNU screen or Tmux and its prefix key is `Ctrl-a`, press `Ctrl-a` twice and `x` to exit). We also provide a Makefile target to allow you to run Pintos just in the terminal: <span style="color:Crimson">`make qemu-nox`</span>.

While by default we run Pintos in QEMU, Pintos can also run in the Bochs and VMWare Player emulator. Bochs will be useful for the Project 1: Threads. To run Pintos with Bochs,


```
cd pintos/src/threads
make 
cd build
pintos --bochs -- run alarm-zero
```

{: .notice--info}
**Exercise 0.1** \\
Take screenshots of the successful booting of Pintos in QEMU and Bochs. Put the screenshots under "pintos/src/p0".

## 2. Debugging

While you are working on the projects, you will frequently use the GNU Debugger (GDB) to help you find bugs in your code. Make sure you read the [GDB section](../test.md) first. In addition, if you are unfamiliar with x86 assembly, the [PCASM](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~huang/cs318/fall21/project/specs/pcasm-book.pdf) is an excellent book to start. Note that you don't need to read the entire book, just the basic ones are enough.

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Exercise 0.2.1**

Your first task in this section is to use GDB to trace the QEMU BIOS a bit to understand how an IA-32 compatible computer boots. Answer the following questions in your design document:

- What is the first instruction that gets executed?
- At which physical address is this instruction located?
- Can you guess why the first instruction is like this?
- What are the next three instructions?
</div>

In the second task, you will be tracing the Pintos bootloader. Set a breakpoint at address 0x7c00, which is where the boot sector will be loaded. Continue execution until that breakpoint. Trace through the code in threads/loader.S, using the source code and the disassembly file threads/build/loader.asm to keep track of where you are. Also use the x/i command in GDB to disassemble sequences of instructions in the boot loader, and compare the original boot loader source code with both the disassembly in threads/build/loader.asm and GDB.

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Exercise 0.2.2**

Trace the Pintos bootloader and answer the following questions in your design document:

* How does the bootloader read disk sectors? In particular, what BIOS interrupt is used?
* How does the bootloader decides whether it successfully finds the Pintos kernel?
* What happens when the bootloader could not find the Pintos kernel?
* At what point and how exactly does the bootloader transfer control to the Pintos kernel?
</div>

After the Pintos kernel take control, the initial setup is done in assembly code threads/start.S. Later on, the kernel will finally kick into the C world by calling the `pintos_init()` function in threads/init.c. Set a breakpoint at `pintos_init()` and then continue tracing a bit into the C initialization code. Then read the source code of `pintos_init()` function.

Suppose we are interested in tracing the behavior of one kernel function `palloc_get_page()` and one global variable` uint32_t *init_page_dir`. For this exercise, you do not need to understand their meaning and the terminology used in them. You will get to know them better in Project 3: Virtual Memory.

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Exercise 0.2.3**

Trace the Pintos kernel and answer the following questions in your design document:

* At the entry of pintos_init(), what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?
* When palloc_get_page() is called for the first time,
    * what does the call stack look like?
    * what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
    * what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal * format?
* When palloc_get_page() is called for the third time,
    * what does the call stack look like?
    * what is the return value in hexadecimal format?
    * what is the value of expression init_page_dir[pd_no(ptov(0))] in hexadecimal format?
</div>

**Hint**

You will want to use GDB commands instead of printf for this exercise.

## 3. Kernel Monitor

At last, you will get to make a small enhancement to Pintos and write some code! In particular, when Pintos finishes booting, it will check for the supplied command line arguments stored in the kernel image. Typically you will pass some tests for the kernel to run, e.g., `pintos -- run alarm-zero`. If there is no command line argument passed (i.e., `pintos --`, note that `--` is needed as a separator for the pintos perl script and is not passed as part of command line arguments to the kernel), the kernel will simply finish up. This is a little boring.

You task is to add a tiny kernel shell to Pintos so that when no command line argument is passed, it will run this shell interactively. Note that this is a kernel-level shell. In later projects, you will be enhancing the user program and file system parts of Pintos, at which point you will get to run the regular shell.

You only need to make this monitor very simple. It starts with a prompt `BUOS>` and waits for user input. As the user types in a printable character, display the character. When a newline is entered, it parses the input and checks if it is `whoami`. If it is `whoami`, print your name. Afterwards, the monitor will print the command prompt `BUOS>` again in the next line and repeat. If the user input is exit, the monitor will quit to allow the kernel to finish. For the other input, print invalid command. Handling special input such as backspace is not required. If you implement such an enhancement, mention this in your design document (C.3).

<div class="notice--info" markdown="1">
**Exercise 0.3**

Enhance threads/init.c to implement a tiny kernel monitor in Pintos. Feel free to add new source files in to the Pintos code base for this task, e.g., provide a `readline` library function. Refer to [Adding Source Files](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~ryanph/jhu/cs318/fall22/project/pintos_3.html#Adding%20Source%20Files) for how to do so.
</div>

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
**Hint**

The code place for you to add this feature is in line 136 of threads/init.c with `// TODO: no command line passed to kernel. Run interactively`.
</div>

<div class="notice--success" markdown="1">
**Hint**
You may need to use some functions provided in lib/kernel/console.c, lib/stdio.c and devices/input.c.
</div>

## Submission
<div class="notice--warning" markdown="1">
**Instruction**

To hand in your submission for this lab, first cd to the root of your pintos source code repository. Commit all the changes you have made for this lab (with `git add` and `git commit` command). Then archive the entire repository with `git archive --prefix=lab0/ --format=tar HEAD | gzip > lab0-handin.tar.gz`. Double check the archive file contains the content you want to submit and then submit lab0-handin.tar.gz through [gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1115359) before the deadline.
