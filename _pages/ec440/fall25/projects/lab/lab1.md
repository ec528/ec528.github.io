# Project 1: Thread

<!-- <span style="color:red">Due: Friday 09/19 11:59 PM EDT (noon)</span> -->

In this assignment, we give you a minimally functional thread system. Your job is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.

* You will be working primarily in the `threads/` directory for this assignment, with some work in the `devices/` directory on the side. Compilation should be done in the `threads/` directory.
* Compilation should be done in the `threads/` directory.

Before diving into the project description, here are some useful resources to guide you:

- [Build and Run](../build.md#1-code-guidance)
- [C Standards](../reference/code_standard.md)

Additionally, the material from [A.1 Loading](../reference/load.md) to [A.5 Memory Allocation](../reference/) in the [Appendix](../reference/appendix.md) will be invaluable, especially the section on [Synchronization](../reference/synchronization.md). Many of your questions, such as how Pintos implements its locks, can be answered in these documents. I recommend skimming through the documentation initially and referring back to it as needed when you encounter specific issues.

To complete the execise 3, you will also need to read [4.4BSD Scheduler](../reference/4.4bsd-scheduler.md).

Here are the sections in this chapter:

* [Background](./lab1_background.md)

* [Project 1 Requirements](./lab1_requirement.md)

* [FAQ](./lab1_faq.md)
