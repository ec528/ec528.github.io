# Project 1: Thread

<!-- <span style="color:red">Due: Friday 09/19 11:59 PM EDT (noon)</span> -->

In this assignment, we give you a minimally functional thread system. Your job is to extend the functionality of this system to gain a better understanding of synchronization problems.

* You will be working primarily in the `threads/` directory for this assignment, with some work in the `devices/` directory on the side. Compilation should be done in the `threads/` directory.
* Compilation should be done in the threads/ directory.

Before you read the description of this project, you should read all the sections in [GETTING STARTED](../lab1_introduction.md) and [C Standards](../coding-standards.md) section. You should at least skim the previous four sections in [Code Guide](../reference-guide/), especially [Synchronization](../reference-guide/synchronization.md). **To complete this project you will also need to read** [**4.4BSD Scheduler**](../../appendix/4.4bsd-scheduler.md)**.**
